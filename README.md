# How does it work?
We will be using SceneViewer by triggering a explicit intent to it. Scene Viewer is an immersive viewer that enables 3D and AR experiences from our Android app. It lets users of our application easily preview, place, view, and interact with web-hosted 3D models in their environment. It uses ARCore, which is Google’s platform for building augmented reality experiences. Using different APIs, ARCore enables our application to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information.

Use this application :
You can download the APK, and then install it (you might have to enable installation from unknown sources).

Or you can clone the repository and import in Android Studio to see the code + build the APK.

Future Scope:
The option for virtual try on/ see in your room can be made available for more and more products by making a separate application for making 3D models by just scanning the object by mobile phone’s camera, which currently requires a professional to make 3D models using heavy graphical softwares. Continuous improvement can be made to the AR technology, making the items even more realistic and improving the overall experience.

Advanced AR Features: As AR technology continues to evolve, there is potential to incorporate more advanced features such as augmented reality games, social shopping experiences, and virtual showrooms, further enhancing the customer experience.
Integration with AI: Integrating AI-powered algorithms can personalize recommendations based on customer preferences and past interactions, creating a more personalized and relevant shopping experience.
